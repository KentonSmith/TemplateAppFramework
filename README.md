# TemplateAppFramework

Android app that is a mashup of the navigation drawer tutorial code in Headfirst Android book (https://github.com/dogriffiths/HeadFirstAndroid) and two most common social login methods: Google+ and Facebook.

Purpose of this app was to provide a template, or quickstart framework for future apps.  Instead of starting from ground zero, one can pull this app and fill out places where things are currently stubbed in.
